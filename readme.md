## Presentation
This Add- on makes poedit more accessible and informative in many aspect of the shortcut command of poedit.
It also indicates the different category of messages by either a beep or a preceded asterisk announcement. The  indicating sound  will help to identify the spots of possible  error and help in correction. It is also possible to issue a command to announce the error.
Now, you can know the   source text and the translation texts separately. Further more, the plural formed messages (if any)can now be distinctly recognized. This will help you to judge the translation accuracy more easily. It avoids the round trip of TAB and shift+TAB if desired to know these messages individually.
